`panelsummary` creates publication-quality regression tables that have multiple panels. Paneled regression tables are particularly useful for showing output for models that are estimated with multiple dependent variables. A simple call to `panelsummary::panelsummary` will create a regression table that can be viewed in the RStudio Viewer panel, be edited with `kableExtra`'s suite of customization functions, and be output to latex. 

As of now, `panelsummary` is intended for use with the `fixest` package, although more model classes are planned. Please use the `panelsummary::models_supported` function to view a list of all model classes that are currently supported.

## Installation

You can install the development version of panelsummary from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("michaeltopper1/panelsummary")
```

## What makes panelsummary different?

`panelsummary` can easily create beautiful paneled tables without any manual editing:

```{r, echo = F, eval = T}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/example_table_readme.png")
```

### Edit with `kableExtra` 

One of the strongest cases to use `panelsummary` is that it returns a `kableExtra` object. This means that you can easily customize your table using `kableExtra`'s suite of functions with the pipe operator (`|>`).

### Use `modelsummary` arguments

Under the hood, `panelsummary::panelsummary` calls `modelsummary::modelsummary` and inherits many of the same arguments. Some examples of arguments that are shared:

* `stars` - indicate significance. 
* `coef_map` - subset, rename, and reorder coefficients.
* `coef_omit` - use regular expressions to determine which coefficients should be omitted from the table.
* `gof_map` - rename, reorder, and omit goodness-of-fit statistics.
